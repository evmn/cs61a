<h2>4.6   Distributed Computing</h2>
<p>Large-scale data processing applications often coordinate effort among multiple
computers.  A distributed computing application is one in which multiple
interconnected but independent computers coordinate to perform a joint
computation.</p>
<p>Different computers are independent in the sense that they do not directly
share memory. Instead, they communicate with each other using <em>messages</em>,
information transferred from one computer to another over a network.</p>
<div class="section" id="messages">
<h3>4.6.1   Messages</h3>
<p>Messages sent between computers are sequences of bytes. The purpose of a
message varies; messages can request data, send data, or instruct another
computer to evaluate a procedure call. In all cases, the sending computer must
encode information in a way that the receiving computer can decode and
correctly interpret. To do so, computers adopt a message protocol that endows
meaning to sequences of bytes.</p>
<p>A <em>message protocol</em> is a set of rules for encoding and interpreting messages.
Both the sending and receiving computers must agree on the semantics of a
message to enable successful communication.  Many message protocols specify
that a message conform to a particular format in which certain bits at fixed
positions indicate fixed conditions. Others use special bytes or byte sequences
to delimit parts of the message, much as punctuation delimits sub-expressions
in the syntax of a programming language.</p>
<p>Message protocols are not particular programs or software libraries.  Instead,
they are rules that can be applied by a variety of programs, even written in
different programming languages.  As a result, computers with vastly different
software systems can participate in the same distributed system, simply by
conforming to the message protocols that govern the system.</p>
<p><strong>The TCP/IP Protocols</strong>. On the Internet, messages are transferred from one
machine to another using the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP), which specifies how to
transfer <em>packets</em> of data among different networks to allow global Internet
communication. IP was designed under the assumption that networks are
inherently unreliable at any point and dynamic in structure. Moreover, it does
not assume that any central tracking or monitoring of communication exists.
Each packet contains a header containing the destination IP address, along with
other information. All packets are forwarded throughout the network toward the
destination using simple routing rules on a best-effort basis.</p>
<p>This design imposes constraints on communication.  Packets transferred using
modern IP implementations (IPv4 and IPv6) have a maximum size of 65,535 bytes.
Larger data values must be split among multiple packets.  The IP does not
guarantee that packets will be received in the same order that they were sent.
Some packets may be lost, and some packets may be transmitted multiple times.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol</a> is an
abstraction defined in terms of the IP that provides reliable, ordered
transmission of arbitrarily large byte streams. The protocol provides this
guarantee by correctly ordering packets transferred by the IP, removing
duplicates, and requesting retransmission of lost packets. This improved
reliability comes at the expense of latency, the time required to send a
message from one point to another.</p>
<p>The TCP breaks a stream of data into <em>TCP segments</em>, each of which includes a
portion of the data preceded by a header that contains sequence and state
information to support reliable, ordered transmission of data. Some TCP
segments do not include data at all, but instead establish or terminate a
connection between two computers.</p>
<p>Establishing a connection between two computers <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> proceeds in
three steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> sends a request to a <em>port</em> of <tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> to establish a TCP connection,
providing a <em>port number</em> to which to send the response.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> sends a response to the port specified by <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> and waits for its
response to be acknowledged.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> sends an acknowledgment response, verifying that data can be
transferred in both directions.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this three-step "handshake", the TCP connection is established, and <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">B</tt> can send data to each other.  Terminating a TCP connection proceeds
as a sequence of steps in which both the client and server request and
acknowledge the end of the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="client-server-architecture">
<h3>4.6.2   Client/Server Architecture</h3>
<p>The client/server architecture is a way to dispense a service from a central
source. A <em>server</em> provides a service and multiple <em>clients</em> communicate with
the server to consume that service. In this architecture, clients and servers
have different roles. The server's role is to respond to service requests from
clients, while a client's role is to issue requests and make use of the
server's response in order to perform some task. The diagram below illustrates
the architecture.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../img/clientserver.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>The most influential use of the model is the modern World Wide Web. When a web
browser displays the contents of a web page, several programs running on
independent computers interact using the client/server architecture. This
section describes the process of requesting a web page in order to illustrate
central ideas in client/server distributed systems.</p>
<p><strong>Roles</strong>. The web browser application on a Web user's computer has the role of
the client when requesting a web page. When requesting the content from a
domain name on the Internet, such as www.nytimes.com, it must communicate
with at least two different servers.</p>
<p>The client first requests the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer
located at that name from a Domain Name Server (DNS). A DNS provides the
service of mapping domain names to IP addresses, which are numerical
identifiers of machines on the Internet.  Python can make such a request
directly using the <tt class="docutils literal">socket</tt> module.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">socket</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">gethostbyname</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">gethostbyname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'www.nytimes.com'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'170.149.172.130'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The client then requests the contents of the web page from the web server
located at that IP address. The response in this case is an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> document that contains headlines and
article excerpts of the day's news, as well as expressions that indicate how
the web browser client should lay out that contents on the user's screen.
Python can make the two requests required to retrieve this content using the
<tt class="docutils literal">urllib.request</tt> module.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">urllib.request</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">urlopen</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">urlopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'http://www.nytimes.com'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">b'&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Upon receiving this response, the browser issues additional requests for
images, videos, and other auxiliary components of the page.  These requests are
initiated because the original HTML document contains addresses of additional
content and a description of how they embed into the page.</p>
<p><strong>An HTTP Request</strong>. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol
implemented using TCP that governs communication for the World Wide Web (WWW).
It assumes a client/server architecture between a web browser and a web server.
HTTP specifies the format of messages exchanged between browsers and servers.
All web browsers use the HTTP format to request pages from a web server, and
all web servers use the HTTP format to send back their responses.</p>
<p>HTTP requests have several types, the most common of which is a <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> request
for a specific web page.  A <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> request specifies a location.  For
instance, typing the address <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley</span></tt> into
a web browser issues an HTTP <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> request to port 80 of the web server
at <tt class="docutils literal">en.wikipedia.org</tt> for the contents at location <tt class="docutils literal">/wiki/UC_Berkeley</tt>.</p>
<p>The server sends back an HTTP response:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 23 May 2011 22:38:34 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)
Last-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2011 23:11:55 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

... web page content ...
</pre>
<p>On the first line, the text <tt class="docutils literal">200 OK</tt>  indicates that there were no errors in
responding to the request.  The subsequent lines of the header give information
about the server, the date, and the type of content being sent back.</p>
<p>If you have typed in a wrong web address, or clicked on a broken link, you may
have seen a message such as this error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
404 Error File Not Found
</pre>
<p>It means that the server sent back an HTTP header that started:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
</pre>
<p>The numbers 200 and 404 are HTTP response codes.  A fixed set of
response codes is a common feature of a message protocol.  Designers of
protocols attempt to anticipate common messages that will be sent via the
protocol and assign fixed codes to reduce transmission size and establish a
common message semantics.  In the HTTP protocol, the 200 response code
indicates success, while 404 indicates an error that a resource was not
found.  A variety of other <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">response codes</a> exist in the HTTP
1.1 standard as well.</p>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong>. The concepts of <em>client</em> and <em>server</em> are powerful
abstractions. A server provides a service, possibly to multiple clients
simultaneously, and a client consumes that service. The clients do not need to
know the details of how the service is provided, or how the data they are
receiving is stored or calculated, and the server does not need to know how its
responses are going to be used.</p>
<p>On the web, we think of clients and servers as being on different machines, but
even systems on a single machine can have client/server architectures. For
example, signals from input devices on a computer need to be generally
available to programs running on the computer. The programs are clients,
consuming mouse and keyboard input data. The operating system's device drivers
are the servers, taking in physical signals and serving them up as usable
input. In addition, the central processing unit (CPU) and the specialized
graphical processing unit (GPU) often participate in a client/server
architecture with the CPU as the client and the GPU as a server of images.</p>
<p>A drawback of client/server systems is that the server is a single point of
failure. It is the only component with the ability to dispense the service.
There can be any number of clients, which are interchangeable and can come and
go as necessary.</p>
<p>Another drawback of client-server systems is that computing resources become
scarce if there are too many clients. Clients increase the demand on the system
without contributing any computing resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-to-peer-systems">
<h3>4.6.3   Peer-to-Peer Systems</h3>
<p>The client/server model is appropriate for service-oriented situations.
However, there are other computational goals for which a more equal division of
labor is a better choice. The term <em>peer-to-peer</em> is used to describe
distributed systems in which labor is divided among all the components of the
system. All the computers send and receive data, and they all contribute some
processing power and memory. As a distributed system increases in size, its
capacity of computational resources increases. In a peer-to-peer system, all
components of the system contribute some processing power and memory to a
distributed computation.</p>
<p>Division of labor among all participants is the identifying characteristic of
a peer-to-peer system. This means that peers need to be able to communicate
with each other reliably. In order to make sure that messages reach their
intended destinations, peer-to-peer systems need to have an organized network
structure. The components in these systems cooperate to maintain enough
information about the locations of other components to send messages to
intended destinations.</p>
<p>In some peer-to-peer systems, the job of maintaining the health of the network
is taken on by a set of specialized components. Such systems are not pure
peer-to-peer systems, because they have different types of components that
serve different functions. The components that support a peer-to-peer network
act like scaffolding: they help the network stay connected, they maintain
information about the locations of different computers, and they help newcomers
take their place within their neighborhood.</p>
<p>The most common applications of peer-to-peer systems are data transfer and data
storage. For data transfer, each computer in the system contributes to send
data over the network. If the destination computer is in a particular
computer's neighborhood, that computer helps send data along. For data storage,
the data set may be too large to fit on any single computer, or too valuable to
store on just a single computer. Each computer stores a small portion of the
data, and there may be multiple copies of the same data spread over different
computers. When a computer fails, the data that was on it can be restored from
other copies and put back when a replacement arrives.</p>
<p>Skype, the voice- and video-chat service, is an example of a data transfer
application with a peer-to-peer architecture. When two people on different
computers are having a Skype conversation, their communications are transmitted
through a peer-to-peer network.  This network is composed of other computers
running the Skype application. Each computer knows the location of a few other
computers in its neighborhood. A computer helps send a packet to its
destination by passing it on a neighbor, which passes it on to some other
neighbor, and so on, until the packet reaches its intended destination. Skype
is not a pure peer-to-peer system. A scaffolding network of <em>supernodes</em> is
responsible for logging-in and logging-out users, maintaining information about
the locations of their computers, and modifying the network structure when
users enter and exit.</p>
