<h2>3.2   Functional Programming</h2>
<p>The software running on any modern computer is written in a variety of
programming languages. There are physical languages, such as the machine
languages for particular computers. These languages are concerned with the
representation of data and control in terms of individual bits of storage and
primitive machine instructions. The machine-language programmer is concerned
with using the given hardware to erect systems and utilities for the efficient
implementation of resource-limited computations. High-level languages, erected
on a machine-language substrate, hide concerns about the representation of data
as collections of bits and the representation of programs as sequences of
primitive instructions. These languages have means of combination and
abstraction, such as function definition, that are appropriate to the
larger-scale organization of software systems.</p>
<p>In this section, we introduce a high-level programming language that encourages
a functional style.  Our object of study, a subset of the Scheme language,
employs a very similar model of computation to Python's, but uses only
expressions (no statements), specializes in symbolic computation, and employs
only immutable values.</p>
<p>Scheme is a dialect of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>, the second-oldest
programming language that is still widely used today (after <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>). The community of Lisp programmers
has continued to thrive for decades, and new dialects of Lisp such as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Clojure</a> have some of the fastest growing
communities of developers of any modern programming language. To follow along
with the examples in this text, you can <a class="reference external" href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme/">download a Scheme interpreter</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="expressions">
<h3>3.2.1   Expressions</h3>
<p>Scheme programs consist of expressions, which are either call expressions or
special forms. A call expression consists of an operator expression followed
by zero or more operand sub-expressions, as in Python. Both the operator and
operand are contained within parentheses:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (quotient 10 2)
5
</pre>
<p>Scheme exclusively uses prefix notation.  Operators are often symbols, such as
<tt class="docutils literal">+</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">*</tt>. Call expressions can be nested, and they may span more than
one line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
19
&gt; (+ (* 3
        (+ (* 2 4)
           (+ 3 5)))
     (+ (- 10 7)
        6))
57
</pre>
<p>As in Python, Scheme expressions may be primitives or combinations.  Number
literals are primitives, while call expressions are combined forms that include
arbitrary sub-expressions. The evaluation procedure of call expressions matches
that of Python: first the operator and operand expressions are evaluated, and
then the function that is the value of the operator is applied to the arguments
that are the values of the operands.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> expression in Scheme is a <em>special form</em>, meaning that while it
looks syntactically like a call expression, it has a different evaluation
procedure.   The general form of an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> expression is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(if &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;consequent&gt; &lt;alternative&gt;)
</pre>
<p>To evaluate an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;predicate&gt;</tt> part of the expression. If the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;predicate&gt;</tt> evaluates to a
true value, the interpreter then evaluates the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;consequent&gt;</tt> and returns its
value.  Otherwise it evaluates the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;alternative&gt;</tt> and returns its value.</p>
<p>Numerical values can be compared using familiar comparison operators, but
prefix notation is used in this case as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (&gt;= 2 1)
#t
</pre>
<p>The boolean values <tt class="docutils literal">#t</tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>) and <tt class="docutils literal">#f</tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>) in Scheme can
be combined with boolean special forms, which have evaluation procedures
similar to those in Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">(and &lt;e1&gt; ... &lt;en&gt;)</tt> The interpreter evaluates the expressions <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt>
one at a time, in left-to-right order. If any <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt> evaluates to <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>,
the value of the <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> expression is <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>, and the rest of the
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt>'s are not evaluated. If all <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt>'s evaluate to true values, the
value of the <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> expression is the value of the last one.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">(or &lt;e1&gt; ... &lt;en&gt;)</tt> The interpreter evaluates the expressions <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt> one
at a time, in left-to-right order. If any <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt> evaluates to a true value,
that value is returned as the value of the <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> expression, and the rest
of the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt>'s are not evaluated. If all <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt>'s evaluate to <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>, the
value of the <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> expression is <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">(not &lt;e&gt;)</tt> The value of a not expression is <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> when the expression
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;e&gt;</tt> evaluates to <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt> otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="definitions">
<h3>3.2.2   Definitions</h3>
<p>Values can be named using the <tt class="docutils literal">define</tt> special form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define pi 3.14)
&gt; (* pi 2)
6.28
</pre>
<p>New functions (called <em>procedures</em> in Scheme) can be defined using a second
version of the <tt class="docutils literal">define</tt> special form. For example, to define squaring, we
write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(define (square x) (* x x))
</pre>
<p>The general form of a procedure definition is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(define (&lt;name&gt; &lt;formal parameters&gt;) &lt;body&gt;)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;name&gt;</tt> is a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition in
the environment. The <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;formal parameters&gt;</tt> are the names used within the body
of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments of the procedure. The
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> is an expression that will yield the value of the procedure
application when the formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to
which the procedure is applied. The <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;name&gt;</tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;formal parameters&gt;</tt>
are grouped within parentheses, just as they would be in an actual call to the
procedure being defined.</p>
<p>Having defined square, we can now use it in call expressions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (square 21)
441

&gt; (square (+ 2 5))
49

&gt; (square (square 3))
81
</pre>
<p>User-defined functions can take multiple arguments and include special forms:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2))
&gt; (average 1 3)
2
&gt; (define (abs x)
    (if (&lt; x 0)
        (- x)
        x))
&gt; (abs -3)
3
</pre>
<p>Scheme supports local definitions with the same lexical scoping rules as
Python. Below, we define an iterative procedure for computing square roots
using nested definitions are recursion:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (sqrt x)
    (define (good-enough? guess)
      (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
    (define (improve guess)
      (average guess (/ x guess)))
    (define (sqrt-iter guess)
      (if (good-enough? guess)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
    (sqrt-iter 1.0))
&gt; (sqrt 9)
3.00009155413138
</pre>
<p>Anonymous functions are created using the <tt class="docutils literal">lambda</tt> special form.  <tt class="docutils literal">Lambda</tt>
is used to create procedures in the same way as <tt class="docutils literal">define</tt>, except that
no name is specified for the procedure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(lambda (&lt;formal-parameters&gt;) &lt;body&gt;)
</pre>
<p>The resulting procedure is just as much a procedure as one that is created
using <tt class="docutils literal">define</tt>. The only difference is that it has not been associated with
any name in the environment. In fact, the following expressions are
equivalent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (plus4 x) (+ x 4))
&gt; (define plus4 (lambda (x) (+ x 4)))
</pre>
<p>Like any expression that has a procedure as its value, a lambda expression can
be used as the operator in a call expression:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; ((lambda (x y z) (+ x y (square z))) 1 2 3)
12
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compound-values">
<h3>3.2.3   Compound values</h3>
<p>Pairs are built into the Scheme language. For historical
reasons, pairs are created with the <tt class="docutils literal">cons</tt> built-in function, and the
elements of a pair are accessed with <tt class="docutils literal">car</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">cdr</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define x (cons 1 2))
&gt; x
(1 . 2)
&gt; (car x)
1
&gt; (cdr x)
2
</pre>
<p>Recursive lists are also built into the language, using pairs. A special value
denoted <tt class="docutils literal">nil</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">'()</tt> represents the empty list. A recursive list value is
rendered by placing its elements within parentheses, separated by spaces:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (cons 1
        (cons 2
              (cons 3
                    (cons 4 nil))))
(1 2 3 4)
&gt; (list 1 2 3 4)
(1 2 3 4)
&gt; (define one-through-four (list 1 2 3 4))
&gt; (car one-through-four)
1
&gt; (cdr one-through-four)
(2 3 4)
&gt; (car (cdr one-through-four))
2
&gt; (cons 10 one-through-four)
(10 1 2 3 4)
&gt; (cons 5 one-through-four)
(5 1 2 3 4)
</pre>
<p>Whether a list is empty can be determined using the primitive <tt class="docutils literal">null?</tt>
predicate. Using it, we can define the standard sequence operations for
computing <tt class="docutils literal">length</tt> and selecting elements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (length items)
    (if (null? items)
        0
        (+ 1 (length (cdr items)))))
&gt; (define (getitem items n)
    (if (= n 0)
        (car items)
        (getitem (cdr items) (- n 1))))
&gt; (define squares (list 1 4 9 16 25))
&gt; (length squares)
5
&gt; (getitem squares 3)
16
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symbolic-data">
<h3>3.2.4   Symbolic Data</h3>
<p>All the compound data objects we have used so far were
constructed ultimately from numbers. One of Scheme's strengths is working
with arbitrary symbols as data.</p>
<p>In order to manipulate symbols we need a new element in our language: the
ability to <em>quote</em> a data object. Suppose we want to construct the list <tt class="docutils literal">(a
b)</tt>. We can't accomplish this with <tt class="docutils literal">(list a b)</tt>, because this expression
constructs a list of the values of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> rather than the symbols
themselves. In Scheme, we refer to the symbols <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> rather than
their values by preceding them with a single quotation mark:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define a 1)
&gt; (define b 2)
&gt; (list a b)
(1 2)
&gt; (list 'a 'b)
(a b)
&gt; (list 'a b)
(a 2)
</pre>
<p>In Scheme, any expression that is not evaluated is said to be <em>quoted</em>. This
notion of quotation is derived from a classic philosophical distinction between
a thing, such as a dog, which runs around and barks, and the word "dog" that is
a linguistic construct for designating such things. When we use "dog" in
quotation marks, we do not refer to some dog in particular but instead to a
word. In language, quotation allow us to talk about language itself, and so it
is in Scheme:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (list 'define 'list)
(define list)
</pre>
<p>Quotation also allows us to type in compound objects, using the conventional
printed representation for lists:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (car '(a b c))
a

&gt; (cdr '(a b c))
(b c)
</pre>
<p>The full Scheme language contains additional features, such as mutation
operations, vectors, and maps. However, the subset we have introduced so far
provides a rich functional programming language capable of implementing many of
the ideas we have discussed so far in this text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turtle-graphics">
<h3>3.2.5   Turtle graphics</h3>
<p>The implementation of Scheme that serves as a companion to this text includes
Turtle graphics, an illustrating environment developed as part of the Logo
language (another Lisp dialect). This turtle begins in the center of a canvas,
moves and turns based on procedures, and draws lines behind it as it moves.
While the turtle was invented to engage children in the act of programming, it
remains an engaging graphical tool for even advanced programmers.</p>
<p>At any moment during the course of executing a Scheme program, the turtle has a
position and heading on the canvas. Single-argument procedures such as
<tt class="docutils literal">forward</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">right</tt> change the position and heading of the turtle. Common
procedures have abbreviations: <tt class="docutils literal">forward</tt> can also be called as <tt class="docutils literal">fd</tt>, etc.
The <tt class="docutils literal">begin</tt> special form in Scheme allows a single expression to include
multiple sub-expressions.  This form is useful for issuing multiple commands:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (repeat k fn) (if (&gt; k 0)
                            (begin (fn) (repeat (- k 1) fn))
                            nil))
&gt; (repeat 5
          (lambda () (fd 100)
                     (repeat 5
                             (lambda () (fd 20) (rt 144)))
                     (rt 144)))
nil
</pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../img/star.png" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>The full repertoire of Turtle procedures is also built into Python as the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html">turtle library module</a>.</p>
<p>As a final example, Scheme can express recursive drawings using its turtle
graphics in a remarkably compact form.  Sierpinski's triangle is a fractal that
draws each triangle as three neighboring triangles that have vertexes at the
midpoints of the legs of the triangle that contains them.  It can be drawn to a
finite recursive depth by this Scheme program:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (define (repeat k fn)
    (if (&gt; k 0)
        (begin (fn) (repeat (- k 1) fn))
        nil))

&gt; (define (tri fn)
    (repeat 3 (lambda () (fn) (lt 120))))

&gt; (define (sier d k)
    (tri (lambda ()
           (if (= k 1) (fd d) (leg d k)))))

&gt; (define (leg d k)
    (sier (/ d 2) (- k 1))
    (penup)
    (fd d)
    (pendown))
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">triangle</tt> procedure is a general method for repeating a drawing
procedure three times with a left turn following each repetition.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">sier</tt> procedure takes a length <tt class="docutils literal">d</tt> and a recursive depth <tt class="docutils literal">k</tt>.  It draws
a plain triangle if the depth is 1, and otherwise draws a triangle made up
of calls to <tt class="docutils literal">leg</tt>.  The <tt class="docutils literal">leg</tt> procedure draws a single leg of a recursive
Sierpinski triangle by a recursive call to <tt class="docutils literal">sier</tt> that fills the first half
of the length of the leg, then by moving the turtle to the next vertex.  The
procedures <tt class="docutils literal">penup</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pendown</tt> stop the turtle from drawing as it moves
by lifting its pen up and the placing it down again. The mutual recursion
between <tt class="docutils literal">sier</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">leg</tt> yields this result:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; (sier 400 6)
