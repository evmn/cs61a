<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, we continue our discussion of real-world applications by
developing new tools to process sequential data. In Chapter 2, we introduced a
sequence interface, implemented in Python by built-in data types such as
<tt class="docutils literal">tuple</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">list</tt>. Sequences supported two operations: querying their
length and accessing an element by index. In Chapter 3, we developed a
user-defined implementations of the sequence interface, the <tt class="docutils literal">Rlist</tt> class for
representing recursive lists. These sequence types proved effective for
representing and accessing a wide variety of sequential datasets.</p>
<p>However, representing sequential data using the sequence abstraction has two
important limitations. The first is that a sequence of length <em>n</em> typically
takes up an amount of memory proportional to <em>n</em>. Therefore, the longer a
sequence is, the more memory it takes to represent it.</p>
<p>The second limitation of sequences is that sequences can only represent
datasets of known, finite length. Many sequential collections that we may want
to represent do not have a well-defined length, and some are even infinite.
Two mathematical examples of infinite sequences are the positive integers and
the Fibonacci numbers. Sequential data sets of unbounded length also appear in
other computational domains. For instance, the sequence of all Twitter posts
grows longer with every second and therefore does not have a fixed length.
Likewise, the sequence of telephone calls sent through a cell tower, the
sequence of mouse movements made by a computer user, and the sequence of
acceleration measurements from sensors on an aircraft all extend without bound
as the world evolves.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we introduce new constructs for working with sequential
data that are designed to accommodate collections of unknown or unbounded
length, while using limited memory. We also discuss how these tools can be used
with a programming construct called a coroutine to create efficient, modular
data processing pipelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implicit-sequences">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit Sequences</a></h2>
<p>The central observation that will lead us to efficient processing of sequential
data is that a sequence can be <em>represented</em> using programming constructs
without each element being <em>stored</em> explicitly in the memory of the computer.
To put this idea into practice, we will construct objects that provides access
to all of the elements of some sequential dataset that an application may
desire, but without computing all of those elements in advance and storing
them.</p>
<p>A simple example of this idea arises in the <tt class="docutils literal">range</tt> sequence type introduced
in Chapter 2. A <tt class="docutils literal">range</tt> represents a consecutive, bounded sequence of
integers. However, it is not the case that each element of that sequence is
represented explicitly in memory.  Instead, when an element is requested from a
<tt class="docutils literal">range</tt>, it is computed. Hence, we can represent very large ranges of
integers without using large blocks of memory. Only the end points of the range
are stored as part of the <tt class="docutils literal">range</tt> object, and elements are computed on the
fly.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; r = range(10000, 1000000000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; r[45006230]
45016230
</pre>
<p>In this example, not all 999,990,000 integers in this range are stored when the
range instance is constructed.  Instead, the range object adds the first
element 10,000 to the index 45,006,230 to produce the element 45,016,230.
Computing values on demand, rather than retrieving them from an existing
representation, is an example of <em>lazy</em> computation. Computer science is a
discipline that celebrates laziness as an important computational tool.</p>
<p>An <em>iterator</em> is an object that provides sequential access to an underlying
sequential dataset. Iterators are built-in objects in many programming
languages, including Python.  The iterator abstraction has two components: a
mechanism for retrieving the <em>next</em> element in some underlying series of
elements and a mechanism for signaling that the end of the series has been
reached and no further elements remain. In programming languages with built-in
object systems, this abstraction typically corresponds to a particular
interface that can be implemented by classes. The Python interface for
iterators is described in the next section.</p>
<p>The usefulness of iterators is derived from the fact that the underlying
series of data for an iterator may not be represented explicitly in memory.
An iterator provides a mechanism for considering each of a series of values in
turn, but all of those elements do not need to be stored simultaneously.
Instead, when the next element is requested from an iterator, that element may
be computed on demand instead of being retrieved from an existing memory
source.</p>
<p>Ranges are able to compute the elements of a sequence lazily because the
sequence represented is uniform, and any element is easy to compute from the
starting and ending bounds of the range. Iterators allow for lazy generation
of a much broader class of underlying sequential datasets, because they do
not need to provide access to arbitrary elements of the underlying series.
Instead, they must only compute the next element of the series, in order, each
time another element is requested. While not as flexible as accessing arbitrary
elements of a sequence (called <em>random access</em>), <em>sequential access</em> to
sequential data series is often sufficient for data processing applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-iterators">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">5.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python Iterators</a></h3>
<p>The Python iterator interface includes two messages. The <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> message
queries the iterator for the next element of the underlying series that it
represents. In response to invoking <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> as a method, an iterator can
perform arbitrary computation in order to either retrieve or compute the next
element in an underlying series. Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> make a mutating change
to the iterator: they advance the position of the iterator. Hence, multiple
calls to <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> will return sequential elements of an underlying series.
Python signals that the end of an underlying series has been reached by
raising a <tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception during a call to <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Letters</tt> class below iterates over an underlying series of letters from
<tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">d</tt>.  The member variable <tt class="docutils literal">current</tt> stores the current letter in
the series, and the <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> method returns this letter and uses it to
compute a new value for <tt class="docutils literal">current</tt>.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; class Letters(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.current = 'a'
        def __next__(self):
            if self.current &gt; 'd':
                raise StopIteration
            result = self.current
            self.current = chr(ord(result)+1)
            return result
        def __iter__(self):
            return self
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> message is the second required message of the Python iterator
interface. It simply returns the iterator; it is useful for providing a common
interface to iterators and sequences, as described in the next section.</p>
<p>Using this class, we can access letters in sequence.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; letters = Letters()
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'c'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 12, in next
StopIteration
</pre>
<p>A <tt class="docutils literal">Letters</tt> instance can only be iterated through once. Once its
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> method raises a <tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception, it continues to do
so from then on. There is no way to reset it; one must create a new instance.</p>
<p>Iterators also allow us to represent infinite series by implementing a
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> method that never raises a <tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception. For
example, the <tt class="docutils literal">Positives</tt> class below iterates over the infinite series of
positive integers.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; class Positives(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.current = 0;
        def __next__(self):
            result = self.current
            self.current += 1
            return result
        def __iter__(self):
            return self
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-statements">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">5.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Statements</a></h3>
<p>In Python, sequences can expose themselves to iteration by implementing the
<tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> message. If an object represents sequential data, it can serve as
an <em>iterable</em> object in a <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement by returning an iterator object in
response to the <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> message. This iterator is meant to have a
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> method that returns each element of the sequence in turn,
eventually raising a <tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception when the end of the sequence
is reached.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; counts = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in counts:
        print(item)
1
2
3
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the <tt class="docutils literal">counts</tt> list returns an iterator in response to a
call to its <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__()</tt> method. The <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement then calls that
iterator's <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> method repeatedly, and assigns the returned value to
<tt class="docutils literal">item</tt> each time. This process continues until the iterator raises a
<tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception, at which point the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement concludes.</p>
<p>With our knowledge of iterators, we can implement the evaluation rule of a
<tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement in terms of <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>, assignment, and <tt class="docutils literal">try</tt> statements.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; i = counts.__iter__()
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
        while True:
            item = i.__next__()
            print(item)
    except StopIteration:
        pass
1
2
3
</pre>
<p>Above, the iterator returned by invoking the <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> method of <tt class="docutils literal">counts</tt>
is bound to a name <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> so that it can be queried for each element in turn.
The handling clause for the <tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception does nothing, but
handling the exception provides a control mechanism for exiting the <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>
loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generators-and-yield-statements">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">5.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generators and Yield Statements</a></h3>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Letters</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Positives</tt> objects above require us to introduce a new
field <tt class="docutils literal">self.current</tt> into our object to keep track of progress through the
sequence. With simple sequences like those shown above, this can be done
easily. With complex sequences, however, it can be quite difficult for the
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> function to save its place in the calculation. Generators allow
us to define more complicated iterations by leveraging the features of the
Python interpreter.</p>
<p>A <em>generator</em> is an iterator returned by a special class of function called a
<em>generator function</em>. Generator functions are distinguished from regular
functions in that rather than containing <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> statements in their body,
they use <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> statement to return elements of a series.</p>
<p>Generators do not use attributes of an object to track their progress through
a series. Instead, they control the execution of the generator function, which
runs until the next <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> statement is executed each time the generator's
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> method is invoked. The <tt class="docutils literal">Letters</tt> iterator can be implemented
much more compactly using a generator function.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def letters_generator():
        current = 'a'
        while current &lt;= 'd':
            yield current
            current = chr(ord(current)+1)
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; for letter in letters_generator():
        print(letter)
a
b
c
d
</pre>
<p>Even though we never explicitly defined <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt>
methods, Python understands that when we use the <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> statement, we are
defining a generator function.  When called, a generator function doesn't
return a particular yielded value, but instead a <tt class="docutils literal">generator</tt> (which is a type
of iterator) that itself can return the yielded values. A generator object has <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> methods, and each call to <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> continues execution of the
generator function from wherever it left off previously until another <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt>
statement is executed.</p>
<p>The first time <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> is called, the program executes statements from
the body of the <tt class="docutils literal">letters_generator</tt> function until it encounters the
<tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> statement. Then, it pauses and returns the value of <tt class="docutils literal">current</tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> statements do not destroy the newly created environment, they
preserve it for later. When <tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt> is called again, execution resumes
where it left off. The values of <tt class="docutils literal">current</tt> and of any other bound names in
the scope of <tt class="docutils literal">letters_generator</tt> are preserved across subsequent calls to
<tt class="docutils literal">__next__</tt>.</p>
<p>We can walk through the generator by manually calling <tt class="docutils literal">____next__()</tt>:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; letters = letters_generator()
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(letters)
&lt;class 'generator'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'c'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters.__next__()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
StopIteration
</pre>
<p>The generator does not start executing any of the body statements of its
generator function until the first time <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> is called.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="iterables">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">5.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iterables</a></h3>
<p>In Python, iterators only make a single pass over the elements of an underlying
series. After that pass, the iterator will continue to raise a
<tt class="docutils literal">StopIteration</tt> exception when <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> is called. Many applications
require iteration over elements multiple times. For example, we have to iterate
over a list many times in order to enumerate all pairs of elements.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def all_pairs(s):
        for item1 in s:
            for item2 in s:
                yield (item1, item2)
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(all_pairs([1, 2, 3]))
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
</pre>
<p>Sequences are not themselves iterators, but instead <em>iterable</em> objects. The
iterable interface in Python consists of a single message, <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt>, that
returns an iterator. The built-in sequence types in Python return new instances
of iterators when their <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> methods are invoked.  If an iterable
object returns a fresh instance of an iterator each time <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> is
called, then it can be iterated over multiple times.</p>
<p>New iterable classes can be defined by implementing the iterable interface. For
example, the <em>iterable</em> <tt class="docutils literal">LetterIterable</tt> class below returns a new iterator
over letters each time <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> is invoked.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; class LetterIterable(object):
        def __iter__(self):
            current = 'a'
            while current &lt;= 'd':
                yield current
                current = chr(ord(current)+1)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">__iter__</tt> method is a generator function; it returns a generator object
that yields the letters <tt class="docutils literal">'a'</tt> through <tt class="docutils literal">'d'</tt>.</p>
<p>A <tt class="docutils literal">Letters</tt> iterator object gets "used up" after a single iteration, whereas the
<tt class="docutils literal">LetterIterable</tt> object can be iterated over multiple times. As a result, a
<tt class="docutils literal">LetterIterable</tt> instance can serve as an argument to <tt class="docutils literal">all_pairs</tt>.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; letters = LetterIterable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; all_pairs(letters).__next__()
('a', 'a')

</div>
<div class="section" id="streams">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">5.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams</a></h3>
<p><em>Streams</em> offer a final way to represent sequential data implicity.  A stream
is a lazily computed recursive list.  Like the <tt class="docutils literal">Rlist</tt> class from Chapter 3,
a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> instance responds to requests for its <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> element and the
<tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of the stream. Like an <tt class="docutils literal">Rlist</tt>, the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> is
itself a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt>.  Unlike an <tt class="docutils literal">Rlist</tt>, the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of a stream is only
computed when it is looked up, rather than being stored in advance. That is,
the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of a stream is computed lazily.</p>
<p>To achieve this lazy evaluation, a stream stores a function that computes the
rest of the stream.  Whenever this function is called, its returned value is
cached as part of the stream in an attribute called <tt class="docutils literal">_rest</tt>, named with an
underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed directly.  The accessible
attribute <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> is a property method that returns the rest of the stream,
computing it if necessary.  With this design, a stream stores <em>how to compute</em>
the rest of the stream, rather than always storing it explicitly.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; class Stream(object):
        """A lazily computed recursive list."""
        def __init__(self, first, compute_rest, empty=False):
            self.first = first
            self._compute_rest = compute_rest
            self.empty = empty
            self._rest = None
            self._computed = False
        @property
        def rest(self):
            """Return the rest of the stream, computing it if necessary."""
            assert not self.empty, 'Empty streams have no rest.'
            if not self._computed:
                self._rest = self._compute_rest()
                self._computed = True
            return self._rest
        def __repr__(self):
            if self.empty:
                return '&lt;empty stream&gt;'
            return 'Stream({0}, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)'.format(repr(self.first))
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; Stream.empty = Stream(None, None, True)
</pre>
<p>A recursive list is defined using a nested expression.  For example,
we can create an <tt class="docutils literal">Rlist</tt> that represents the elements <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> then <tt class="docutils literal">5</tt> as
follows:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; r = Rlist(1, Rlist(2+3, Rlist.empty))
</pre>
<p>Likewise, we can create a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> representing the same series.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> does not actually compute the second element <tt class="docutils literal">5</tt> until the rest of
the stream is requested.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = Stream(1, lambda: Stream(2+3, lambda: Stream.empty))
</pre>
<p>Here, <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> is the first element of the stream, and the <tt class="docutils literal">lambda</tt> expression
that follows returns a function for computing the rest of the stream. The
second element of the computed stream is a function that returns an empty
stream.</p>
<p>Accessing the elements of recursive list <tt class="docutils literal">r</tt> and stream <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> proceed
similarly.  However, while <tt class="docutils literal">5</tt> is stored within <tt class="docutils literal">r</tt>, it is computed on
demand for <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> via addition the first time that it is requested.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; r.first
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.first
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; r.rest.first
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.rest.first
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; r.rest
Rlist(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.rest
Stream(5, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)
</pre>
<p>While the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of <tt class="docutils literal">r</tt> is a one-element recursive list, the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> of
<tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> includes a function to compute the rest; the fact that it will return the
empty stream may not yet have been discovered.</p>
<p>When a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> instance is constructed, the field <tt class="docutils literal">self._computed</tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>, signifying that the <tt class="docutils literal">_rest</tt> of the <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt> has not yet been
computed. When the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> attribute is requested via a dot expression, the
<tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt> method is invoked, which triggers computation with <tt class="docutils literal">self._rest =
self.compute_rest</tt>.  Because of the caching mechanism within a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt>, the
<tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> function is only ever called once.</p>
<p>The essential properties of a <tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> function are that it takes no
arguments, and it returns a <tt class="docutils literal">Stream</tt>.</p>
<p>Lazy evaluation gives us the ability to represent infinite sequential datasets
using streams. For example, we can represent increasing integers, starting at
any <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> value.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def make_integer_stream(first=1):
      def compute_rest():
        return make_integer_stream(first+1)
      return Stream(first, compute_rest)
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; ints = make_integer_stream()
&gt;&gt;&gt; ints
Stream(1, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ints.first
1
</pre>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal">make_integer_stream</tt> is called for the first time, it returns a stream
whose <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> is the first integer in the sequence (<tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> by default).
However, <tt class="docutils literal">make_integer_stream</tt> is actually recursive because this stream's
<tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> calls <tt class="docutils literal">make_integer_stream</tt> again, with an incremented
argument. This makes <tt class="docutils literal">make_integer_stream</tt> recursive, but also lazy.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; ints.first
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; ints.rest.first
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; ints.rest.rest
Stream(3, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)
</pre>
<p>Recursive calls are only made to <tt class="docutils literal">make_integer_stream</tt> whenever the <tt class="docutils literal">rest</tt>
of an integer stream is requested.</p>
<p>The same higher-order functions that manipulate sequences -- <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">filter</tt> -- also apply to streams, although their implementations must change
to apply their argument functions lazily.  The function <tt class="docutils literal">map_stream</tt> maps a
function over a stream, which produces a new stream.  The locally defined
<tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> function ensures that the function will be mapped onto the
rest of the stream whenever the rest is computed.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def map_stream(fn, s):
        if s.empty:
            return s
        def compute_rest():
            return map_stream(fn, s.rest)
        return Stream(fn(s.first), compute_rest)
</pre>
<p>A stream can be filtered by defining a <tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> function that applies
the filter function to the rest of the stream.  If the filter function rejects
the first element of the stream, the rest is computed immediately.  Because
<tt class="docutils literal">filter_stream</tt> is recursive, the rest may be computed multiple times until a
valid <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> element is found.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def filter_stream(fn, s):
        if s.empty:
            return s
        def compute_rest():
            return filter_stream(fn, s.rest)
        if fn(s.first):
            return Stream(s.first, compute_rest)
        return compute_rest()
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">map_stream</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">filter_stream</tt> functions exhibit a common pattern in
stream processing: a locally defined <tt class="docutils literal">compute_rest</tt> function recursively
applies a processing function to the rest of the stream whenever the rest is
computed.</p>
<p>To inspect the contents of a stream, we can truncate it to finite length and
convert it to a Python <tt class="docutils literal">list</tt>.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def truncate_stream(s, k):
        if s.empty or k == 0:
            return Stream.empty
        def compute_rest():
            return truncate_stream(s.rest, k-1)
        return Stream(s.first, compute_rest)
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def stream_to_list(s):
        r = []
        while not s.empty:
            r.append(s.first)
            s = s.rest
        return r
</pre>
<p>These convenience functions allow us to verify our <tt class="docutils literal">map_stream</tt>
implementation with a simple example that squares the integers from <tt class="docutils literal">3</tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal">7</tt>.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = make_integer_stream(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
Stream(3, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = map_stream(lambda x: x*x, s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m
Stream(9, &lt;compute_rest&gt;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; stream_to_list(truncate_stream(m, 5))
[9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
</pre>
<p>We can use our <tt class="docutils literal">filter_stream</tt> function to define a stream of prime numbers
using the sieve of Eratosthenes, which filters a stream of integers to remove
all numbers that are multiples of its first element.  By successively filtering
with each prime, all composite numbers are removed from the stream.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def primes(pos_stream):
        def not_divible(x):
            return x % pos_stream.first != 0
        def compute_rest():
            return primes(filter_stream(not_divible, pos_stream.rest))
        return Stream(pos_stream.first, compute_rest)
</pre>
<p>By truncating the <tt class="docutils literal">primes</tt> stream, we can enumerate any prefix of the prime
numbers.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = primes(make_integer_stream(2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; stream_to_list(truncate_stream(p1, 7))
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
</pre>
<p>Streams contrast with iterators in that they can be passed to pure functions
multiple times and yield the same result each time.  The primes stream is not
"used up" by converting it to a list.  That is, the <tt class="docutils literal">first</tt> element of <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt>
is still <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt> after converting the prefix of the stream to a list.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; p1.first
2
</pre>
<p>Just as recursive lists provide a simple implementation of the sequence
abstraction, streams provide a simple, functional, recursive data structure
that implements lazy evaluation through the use of higher-order functions.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coroutines</a></h2>
<p>Much of this text has focused on techniques for decomposing complex programs
into small, modular components.  When the logic for a function with complex
behavior is divided into several self-contained steps that are themselves
functions, these functions are called helper functions or <em>subroutines</em>.
Subroutines are called by a main function that is responsible for coordinating
the use of several subroutines.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="img/subroutine.png" src="05_files/subroutine.png" style="height: 300px;">
</div>
<p>In this section, we introduce a different way of decomposing complex
computations using <em>coroutines</em>, an approach that is particularly applicable to
the task of processing sequential data.  Like a subroutine, a coroutine
computes a single step of a complex computation. However, when using
coroutines, there is no main function to coordinate results. Instead coroutines
themselves link together to form a pipeline. There may be a coroutine for
consuming the incoming data and sending it to other coroutines.  There may be
coroutines that each do simple processing steps on data sent to them, and there
may finally be another coroutine that outputs a final result.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="img/coroutine.png" src="05_files/coroutine.png" style="width: 400px;">
</div>
<p>The difference between coroutines and subroutines is conceptual: subroutines
slot into an overarching function to which they are subordinate, whereas
coroutines are all colleagues, they cooperate to form a pipeline without any
supervising function responsible for calling them in a particular order.</p>
<p>In this section, we will learn how Python supports building coroutines with the
<tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">send()</tt> statements. Then, we will look at different roles that
coroutines can play in a pipeline, and how coroutines can support multitasking.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-coroutines">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">5.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python Coroutines</a></h3>
<p>In the previous section, we introduced generator functions, which use <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt>
to return values. Python generator functions can also consume values using a
<tt class="docutils literal">(yield)</tt> statement. In addition two new methods on generator objects,
<tt class="docutils literal">send()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">close()</tt>, create a framework for objects that <em>consume</em> and
produce values. Generator functions that define these objects are coroutines.</p>
<p>Coroutines consume values using a <tt class="docutils literal">(yield)</tt> statement as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">value = (yield)
</pre>
<p>With this syntax, execution pauses at this statement until the object's
<tt class="docutils literal">send</tt> method is invoked with an argument:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">coroutine.send(data)
</pre>
<p>Then, execution resumes, with <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> being assigned to the value of
<tt class="docutils literal">data</tt>. To signal the end of a computation, we shut down a coroutine using
the <tt class="docutils literal">close()</tt> method. This raises a <tt class="docutils literal">GeneratorExit</tt> exception inside the
coroutine, which we can catch with a <tt class="docutils literal">try/except</tt> clause.</p>
<p>The example below illustrates these concepts. It is a coroutine that prints
strings that match a provided pattern.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def match(pattern):
        print('Looking for ' + pattern)
        try:
            while True:
                s = (yield)
                if pattern in s:
                    print(s)
        except GeneratorExit:
            print("=== Done ===")
</pre>
<p>We initialize it with a pattern, and call <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> to start execution:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; m = match("Jabberwock")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.__next__()
Looking for Jabberwock
</pre>
<p>The call to <tt class="docutils literal">__next__()</tt> causes the body of the function to be executed, so
the line "Looking for jabberwock" gets printed out. Execution continues until
the statement <tt class="docutils literal">line = (yield)</tt> is encountered. Then, execution pauses, and
waits for a value to be sent to <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>. We can send values to it using <tt class="docutils literal">send</tt>.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; m.send("the Jabberwock with eyes of flame")
the Jabberwock with eyes of flame
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.send("came whiffling through the tulgey wood")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.send("and burbled as it came")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.close()
=== Done ===
</pre>
<p>When we call <tt class="docutils literal">m.send</tt> with a value, evaluation resumes inside the coroutine
<tt class="docutils literal">m</tt> at the statement <tt class="docutils literal">line = (yield)</tt>, where the sent value is assigned to
the variable <tt class="docutils literal">line</tt>. Evaluation continues inside <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>, printing out the line
if it matches, going through the loop until it encounters <tt class="docutils literal">line = (yield)</tt>
again.  Then, evaluation pauses inside <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt> and resumes where <tt class="docutils literal">m.send</tt> was
called.</p>
<p>We can chain functions that <tt class="docutils literal">send()</tt> and functions that <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> together
achieve complex behaviors. For example, the function below splits a string
named <tt class="docutils literal">text</tt> into words and sends each word to another coroutine.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; def read(text, next_coroutine):
        for line in text.split():
            next_coroutine.send(line)
        next_coroutine.close()
</pre>
<p>Each word is sent to the coroutine bound to <tt class="docutils literal">next_coroutine</tt>, causing
<tt class="docutils literal">next_coroutine</tt> to start executing, and this function to pause and wait. It
waits until <tt class="docutils literal">next_coroutine</tt> pauses, at which point the function resumes by
sending the next word or completing.</p>
<p>If we chain this function together with <tt class="docutils literal">match</tt> defined above, we can create
a program that prints out only the words that match a particular word.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; text = 'Commending spending is offending to people pending lending!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher = match('ending')
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher.__next__()
Looking for ending
&gt;&gt;&gt; read(text, matcher)
Commending
spending
offending
pending

=== Done ===
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">read</tt> function sends each word to the coroutine <tt class="docutils literal">matcher</tt>, which
prints out any input that matches its <tt class="docutils literal">pattern</tt>. Within the <tt class="docutils literal">matcher</tt>
coroutine, the line <tt class="docutils literal">s = (yield)</tt> waits for each sent word, and it transfers
control back to <tt class="docutils literal">read</tt> when it is reached.</p>
